# General

- Keep PRs focused and small. One feature or fix per PR.

# CSS

- Prefer utility-like, minimal CSS. Avoid heavy overrides.
- Respect the candy corn palette and Kawaii Halloween aesthetic.
- Reuse existing variables/tokens if available.

# JavaScript

- Avoid large dependencies; stick to Dawn‚Äôs lightweight approach.
- Progressive enhancement: don‚Äôt break core functionality without JS.
  
# Commit messages

  - fix: correct cart icon stroke width on mobile
  - feat: add setting to toggle candy-corn CTA style
  - docs: add MIT + Dawn attribution to README
